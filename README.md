# Image Generation and Classification Project with GAN, Stable Diffusion and VGG16
This project implements a system to generate images using a GAN and Stable Diffusion, comparing them with real images using a reimplemented VGG16 to extract features and predict the class of the images (real or generated).
It also includes the metrics as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.
# Stable diffusion
We utilise a pre-trained model
