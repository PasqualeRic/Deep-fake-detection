Image Generation and Classification Project with GAN and Stable Diffusion
This project implements a system for generating images using GAN and Stable Diffusion, comparing them with real images through a VGG16 model to extract features and an SVM classifier to predict whether images are real or generated. The project also includes the calculation of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

Features
Image Generation:

Stable Diffusion: Generates 2000 images based on text prompts extracted from the COCO dataset.
GAN: Generates 2000 images using a pre-trained GAN generator model.
Metric Calculation:

Inception Score (IS): Evaluates the quality and diversity of generated images.
Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID): Measures how similar the generated images are to real images.
Feature Importance Score (FIS): Compares feature distributions between real and generated images.
Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for binary classification (real vs generated) using a pre-trained SVM classifier and VGG16 for feature extraction.
Image Compression:

The project allows generating compressed datasets with JPEG compression at various quality levels (40%, 60%, 80%).
